      <h2>Introducing My Site</h2>
      <p>
        I currently nourish my growth mindset and apply my love of D-I-Y
        remotely for a Software Development School as a fulltime Teacher's
        Assistant and part-time student. I enjoy hacking away at web
        applications in my spare time a few hours a day when I'm not working on
        a code review, leading a standup or bursting with satisfaction and joy
        from the bug we just solved together. On the rare occasion that I am not
        in a zoom call, terminal, or slack chat; chances are you'll find me
        turning a wrench under my project jeep or just cooling it by a creek in
        the forest.
